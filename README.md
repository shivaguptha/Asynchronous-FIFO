# Asynchronous FIFO (Gray Code Pointers)

A robust, parameterizable asynchronous FIFO implementation in Verilog using Gray code pointers for safe clock domain crossing.

## Overview

This asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer enables safe data transfer between two independent clock domains. It uses Gray code counters and proper synchronization techniques to prevent metastability and ensure reliable operation across different clock frequencies.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Operation**: Independent write and read clock domains
- **Gray Code Pointers**: Eliminates multiple bit transitions for reliable synchronization
- **Parameterizable**: Configurable data width and FIFO depth
- **Status Flags**: Full and empty indicators with proper synchronization
- **Metastability Protection**: Double-register synchronizers for clock domain crossing
- **Memory Efficient**: Uses simple dual-port memory structure

## Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Dual-Port Memory**: Stores FIFO data with separate read/write ports
2. **Binary Counters**: Track actual memory addresses for read/write operations
3. **Gray Code Counters**: Provide safe pointer comparison across clock domains
4. **Synchronizers**: Two-stage flip-flop chains for reliable clock domain crossing
5. **Status Logic**: Generates full/empty flags based on synchronized pointers

### Gray Code Advantage

Gray code ensures only one bit changes at a time during counter increments, significantly reducing the probability of metastability when crossing clock domains.

## Module Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `DATA_WIDTH` | 8 | Width of data bus in bits |
| `DEPTH` | 16 | Number of FIFO entries (must be power of 2) |

## Port Description

### Inputs
- `wr_clk`: Write clock domain
- `rd_clk`: Read clock domain  
- `rst`: Asynchronous reset (active high)
- `wr_en`: Write enable signal
- `rd_en`: Read enable signal
- `din[DATA_WIDTH-1:0]`: Data input

### Outputs
- `dout[DATA_WIDTH-1:0]`: Data output
- `full`: FIFO full flag (synchronized to write clock)
- `empty`: FIFO empty flag (synchronized to read clock)

## Usage Example

```verilog
// Instantiate 32-bit wide, 64-entry FIFO
async_fifo #(
    .DATA_WIDTH(32),
    .DEPTH(64)
) my_fifo (
    .wr_clk(write_clock),
    .rd_clk(read_clock),
    .rst(reset),
    .wr_en(write_enable & ~full),  // Prevent writes when full
    .rd_en(read_enable & ~empty),  // Prevent reads when empty
    .din(data_in),
    .dout(data_out),
    .full(fifo_full),
    .empty(fifo_empty)
);
```

## Operation Guidelines

### Writing Data
1. Check `full` flag before asserting `wr_en`
2. Present data on `din` and assert `wr_en` on `wr_clk` rising edge
3. Data is written when `wr_en` is high and `full` is low

### Reading Data
1. Check `empty` flag before asserting `rd_en`
2. Assert `rd_en` on `rd_clk` rising edge
3. Valid data appears on `dout` after the clock edge when `rd_en` is high and `empty` is low

### Reset Behavior
- Asynchronous reset clears all pointers and status flags
- FIFO appears empty after reset
- Memory contents are not cleared (don't rely on reset data)

## Design Considerations

### Clock Domain Crossing
- Gray code pointers ensure safe synchronization
- Two-stage synchronizers provide adequate metastability protection
- Pointer comparisons are done in respective clock domains

### Full and Empty Detection
- **Full**: Write Gray pointer equals read Gray pointer with MSB inverted
- **Empty**: Read Gray pointer equals synchronized write Gray pointer
- Flags are pessimistic (safe) during synchronization delays

### Performance
- **Latency**: 
  - Write to read: ~2-3 read clock cycles
  - Status flag updates: ~2 clock cycles in respective domains
- **Throughput**: Limited by slower of the two clock domains

## Files

- `design.v`: Main asynchronous FIFO module implementation
- `testbench.v`: Comprehensive testbench with multiple test scenarios

## Simulation

The provided testbench (`testbench.v`) includes:

1. **Basic Operation**: Write and read operations
2. **Full Condition**: Tests behavior when FIFO becomes full
3. **Overflow Protection**: Attempts to write when full
4. **Mixed Operations**: Interleaved read/write operations
5. **Different Clock Rates**: Write clock (10ns) vs Read clock (15ns)

### Running Simulation

```bash
# Using ModelSim/QuestaSim
vlog design.v testbench.v
vsim tb_async_fifo
run -all

# Using Icarus Verilog
iverilog -o fifo_sim design.v testbench.v
vvp fifo_sim
```

### Expected Output
The testbench generates detailed console output showing:
- Write operations with data values and full status
- Read operations with retrieved data and empty status
- Full/empty condition testing
- Timing relationships between clock domains

## Synthesis Considerations

- **FPGA**: Direct synthesis to block RAM or distributed RAM
- **ASIC**: May require memory compiler for optimal implementation
- **Timing**: Ensure adequate setup/hold margins for synchronizers
- **Power**: Consider clock gating for unused portions

## Known Limitations

1. **Depth Requirement**: FIFO depth must be a power of 2
2. **Synchronization Delay**: 2-3 clock cycles for status flag updates
3. **Reset Synchronization**: Reset should be properly synchronized to both domains
4. **Memory Initialization**: Memory contents undefined after reset
